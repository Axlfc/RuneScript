   ```

   ```sh
   git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
   ```
5. **Push Your Changes to GitHub**:
   - Push your branch to your forked repository:

## **Adding New Features or Files**

### **File Naming Guidelines**
When creating new files, use descriptive names that clearly explain their purpose. For features that involve multiple files, organize them in a new folder.

- **Scripts**: Use camelCase for script files.
  ```plaintext
  exampleFeatureScript.py
  ```
- **Posts or Logs**: Use the format `YYYY-MM-DD-title.md` for markdown files.
  ```plaintext
  2024-12-01-new-ai-integration.md
  ```

Place these files in their respective directories (e.g., `src/scripts`, `docs/posts`).
