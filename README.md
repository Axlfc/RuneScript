## TODO:

- Add menu section 'Jobs' that have two subsections, 'at' and 'crontab'. Each one opens another window that shows current jobs in a grid with a checkbox in the left to let users be able to delete scheduled jobs individually or all of them if they select multiple checkboxes when press 'Remove' button.
- Add Functional Program Keyboard Shortcuts
- Undo / Redo
- Show file line numbers in the left
- Find / Replace
- Adding fonts
